I can create websites that can adapt to different screen sizes. This ensures
the best browsing experience for the user regardless of the device they are
viewing the website on. If a significant percentage of the websites visitors
are browsing using mobile devices, providing them with an easier way to access
the content could lead to higher profits.

Designing for mobile first will enable quicker load times on mobile devices.

This website displays my implementation of media queries to enable the website to display differently on computers, tablets and mobiles.

The media queries detects the screen size and changes the elements on the page to ensure that the website is displayed correctly. Changes implemented include:
	resizing fonts,
	changing menus,
	displaying less content, and
	moving elements.
